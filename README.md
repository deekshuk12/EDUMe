# EDUMe üìöüåê

## Inspiration
In the realm of education, one size does not fit all. Learning disabilities are encountered by students worldwide, with approximately one out of every seven individuals being affected by a learning disability. There is a lack of educational materials and resources for students with disabilities and unique learning styles. We envisioned EDUMe as a solution to bridge this gap. We designed EDUMe to revolutionize the way people learn by delivering personalized content tailored to individual learning styles. Drawing inspiration from the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 4, our mission is to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education for all, regardless of their background or learning preferences. We wanted create a platform that leverages Generative AI to make learning more accessible and personalized for students with various learning styles. 

## What it does
EDUMe utilizes the power of GenAI to dynamically generate learning content tailored to individual learning styles. By analyzing user preferences and behavior, it curates educational materials ranging from articles and videos to interactive quizzes. Through its intuitive interface, users can engage with content that resonates with their unique way of learning, fostering a deeper understanding and retention of knowledge. 

Users answer a series of questions, where we assess and pinpoint your preferred learning style. Users can then search questions, where you are given customized content. We assess users learning with generative quizzes. If users get questions wrong, we generate new content to reinforce learning. 

## How we built it
We developed EDUMe using a combination of Streamlit for the frontend and OpenAI's and YouTube's API for generating educational content. We used Python for the back-end to create a quiz that assess's an individual's preferred learning style.

## Challenges we ran into
We struggled with working collaboratively with API keys while working remotely due to a rate limit error. In addition, we had difficulties integrating the voice to text feature in our application. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of creating a fully functional prototype. We were able to effectively connect the front-end and back-end. 

## What we learned
Throughout this hackathon, we learned how to use ChatGPT's OpenAI API and the Youtube API to generate content based on an individual's learning style. We also learned how to use Stream-lit to build our front-end application and connect our front-end and back-end. 

## What's next for EDUMe
To improve EDUMe, we would like to integrate MongoDB to store user information and create user profiles to generate more personalized recommendations and track progress of learning. Next, we would like to improve the quality of our quiz results, tailoring the results to a wider range of disabilities and learning styles. Finally, we would like to implement an 'Evaluation' feature to track the progress of student's learning in different subjects.
